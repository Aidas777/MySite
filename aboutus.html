                I started my programming journey with <b>Microsoft Access</b>
                where over eight years I built complete applications and workflow tools for various companies.
                Later, I studied <b>PHP, JavaScript, Laravel, HTML, CSS, WordPress, Bootstrap, Java, Visual Basic (VBA), MS SQL, PL/SQL, Linux</b> and other technologies.
                As you can see I use GitHub also as this site is hosted on it.
                <br><br>
                I enjoy creating efficient, practical solutions and continuously learning new technologies to improve my work.
